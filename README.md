# Seats

During my internship at Kingston University, facilitated by CSE Connect, I worked with my team to build a web application for managing seating arrangements for our client’s events. I designed and helped implement the app and worked on programming its features, so that planning events would be easier and more efficient.

## Project Objectives

The client had trouble managing attendee seating for business events, like Christmas parties, and needed a way to organize guests more easily. The project aimed to make event planning simpler and more efficient. The main goals were:

- Automating seating plans to make organizing events easier.
- Helping manage event and employee data.
- Allowing easy import and export of data.
- Creating a user interface that was simple and easy to use.

## Technologies Used

- React and Node.js for building the web application.
- JavaScript and CSS for programming and styling.
- PapaParse for importing and exporting data efficiently.
- Agile development practices to manage tasks and sprints.
- Collaboration tools to coordinate work within the team.

## User Interface

I designed the interface in Figma to reflect the client’s brand as a law firm. Their signature green was used as the main accent to maintain consistency with their logo and overall branding.

The client requested a dark layout, so I experimented with color combinations in Paletton to create a professional and minimalistic look suitable for their industry.

I also researched modern UI design trends to develop a visual style that feels intuitive and familiar for new users.

Using an Agile approach, I adapted the layouts each week to incorporate new requirements. This kept the client involved throughout the process and ensured the final design met their expectations.

The end result is a consistent, user-friendly interface that aligns closely with the client’s identity and provides a professional experience.

Thanks to the collaboration with the deployment and authentication team at Kingston University, the project was successfully deployed! Try it yourself!
